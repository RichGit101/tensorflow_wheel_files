# Tensorflow wheel files

This project is to upload and maintain my own copiled tensorflow wheel files. Go ahead and enjoy

## Getting Started

You can install tensorflow with the wheel file available as below:

sudo pip2 install <wheel-file> (for a wheel file compiled in python 2.7)

### Prerequisites

Everything mentioned in description for each of the file, is a prerequisites :P


#### tensorflow-1.9.0-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl 

This wheel file is compiled with the folowing:
Tensorflow 1.9
CUDA 9.2 (compute capability 3.0)
CUDNN 7.1.4
NCCL 2.2.13
with jemalloc as malloc
with XLA JIT compiler and
